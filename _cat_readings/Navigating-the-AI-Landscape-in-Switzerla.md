Switzerland's energy and health sectors will see the rapid adoption of AI systems in the coming years. Anticipated benefits include better, personalised healthcare, a reduced burden on health professionals, and more reliable energy production and distribution through a more resilient power grid. However, conversations with experts from the two fields reveal uncertainties regarding the liability of automated decision-making, and concerns
around deploying AI systems in a fair, secure, and controlled fashion as well as a lack of evaluation schemes and certifications common for other technologies in those industries.
Swiss think tank Pour Demain conducted interviews with experts from 38 Swiss organisations in the energy and healthcare sectors to assess their use of AI systems.

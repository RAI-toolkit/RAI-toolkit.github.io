Passionate of responsible development and social implications of technology, I have more than 12 years of experience in brain-machine interaction, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. My work is focused on the conception of neurotechnologies that allow symbiotic interaction between human and intelligent machines. This is based on better understanding of neural correlates of cognition, development of artificial intelligent devices capable to adapt to their user's goals, preferences and capabilities, and a user-centered design approach.<br/> 

Highly interested on the translation of emerging technologies onto applications at service of society, I am the head of the Switzerland Office of the [CLAIRE Initiative for excellence in AI](http://claire-ai.org). I am also chair the [IEEE group on standards for brain-machine interfacing](https://standards.ieee.org/industry-connections/neurotechnologies-for-brain-machine-interfacing.html) and executive-in-residence at the [Geneva Cente for Security Policy](https://www.gcsp.ch/home). I am chair of the publications committee of the [IEEE Brain Initiative](http://brain.ieee.org/category/newsletter/) and member of the [MIT Technology Review](https://insights.techreview.com) Global Panel<br/>

I have a degree on Electronics Engineering from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Cali, Colombia and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience from the <a href="http://epfl.ch">Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> In Switzerland.<br/>

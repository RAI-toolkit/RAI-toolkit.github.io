The new national cyberstrategy (NCS) was approved by the Federal Council during its meeting on 5 April 2023 and by the cantons during today's plenary session of the CCJPD. The strategy sets out the objectives and measures with which the federal government and the cantons, together with the business community and universities, intend to counter cyberthreats. A steering committee will be established to plan and coordinate the implementation of the strategy, and will also refine it. Its role is to be expanded and its independence increased.

The Recommendation on the Ethics of AI provides a framework to ensure that AI developments align with the promotion and protection of human rights and human dignity, environmental sustainability, fairness, inclusion and gender equality. It underscores that these goals and principles should inform technological developments in an ex-ante manner. To support effective implementation, UNESCO developed two instruments, the Readiness Assessment Methodology and the Ethical Impact Assessment.

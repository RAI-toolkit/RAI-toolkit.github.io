The Atlas of Automation aims to shed light into this black box. It offers a first directory of examples of algorithmic systems that are used in Switzerland, whether by government agencies or the private sector. It focuses on algorithmic systems that are used in decision-making, thus to predict, recommend, affect or take decisions about human beings, or that generate content used by or on human beings. It does not aim to be comprehensive but rather illustrates the variety of use cases, through which algorithms affect us and our society.
